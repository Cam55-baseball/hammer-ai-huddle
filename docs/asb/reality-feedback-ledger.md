# Reality Feedback Ledger

**Sprint:** Post-Launch Observability & Reality Validation
**Posture:** Append-only human-curated ledger. **Not organism truth.** Never authored by the engine. Records production observations for the next sprint to consider — no fixes here.

## Format

| id | observed_behavior | evidence | frequency | severity | recommended_future_action | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

- **evidence** — `event_id` / SQL query / `file:line` reference. Must be replay-reconstructable.
- **frequency** — how often observed (per day, per cohort, etc.).
- **severity** — `info | warn | high | P0`.
- **status** — `observed | triaged | scheduled | resolved`.

## Pre-seeded entries (from Sections A–F instrumentation gaps)

## Append-only policy

- Never delete rows. Status transitions only.
- Every new production observation appends a new row with monotonic `RFL-NNN` id.
- Each row must include reproducible evidence. No anecdotes.
- This ledger feeds **prioritization**, not architecture mutation. Architecture changes still flow through the constitutional sprint process.

## Audit-only additions — Coach Hammer Authority Audit (2026-06-06)

See `docs/asb/coach-hammer-authority-audit.md` and `docs/asb/coach-hammer-roadmap.md`.

| ID | Finding | Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| RFL-011 | Two next-step engines (`useCoachHammerNextStep` vs `useNextAction`) under Hammer brand can disagree across Dashboard vs Today | M | Open |
| RFL-012 | `PrescriptiveActionsCard` navigates to `/practice-hub` which does not exist → 404 | M | Open |
| RFL-013 | Hammer reasoning never reads `profiles` (position, throws/bats, grade, experience) | M | Open |
| RFL-014 | 4 of 9 daily modalities (hitting, defense, baserunning, fueling) absent from canonical prescription | M | Open |
| RFL-015 | Onboarding does not perform Hammer-led knowledge-gap acquisition | M | Open |
| RFL-016 | Ask-Coach (HelpDeskChat) is a separate AI surface from Coach Hammer | L | Open |

## RFL closures — Coach Hammer Authority Consolidation Sprint

| ID | Status | Closure evidence |
|---|---|---|
| RFL-011 | CLOSED | `src/hooks/useHammerNextStep.ts` — single canonical next-step authority arbitrating AI ⇢ deterministic. |
| RFL-012 | CLOSED | `src/components/hie/PrescriptiveActionsCard.tsx` — `/practice-hub` → `/practice`. |
| RFL-013 | CLOSED | `src/lib/hammer/context/athleteContext.ts` reads `profiles` (position, sport, experience_level, school_grade, …). |
| RFL-014 | CLOSED | `src/lib/hammer/prescription/dailyPlan.ts` — 9/9 modalities present (warm-up · speed · strength · hitting · throwing · defense · baserunning · fueling · recovery). |
| RFL-015 | CLOSED | `src/hooks/useHammerOnboardingDirector.ts` + `src/components/hammer/HammerOnboardingChat.tsx` — Hammer-led knowledge-gap acquisition (9-gap registry). |
| RFL-016 | CLOSED | `supabase/functions/hammer-chat/index.ts` + `src/hooks/useHammerChat.ts` + `src/components/hammer/HammerChat.tsx` — unified Ask-Coach surface with single identity + context + canonical next step. |

See `docs/asb/coach-hammer-final-ratification.md` for the full ratification.

## RFL closures — Coach Hammer Completion & Runtime Ratification Sprint (2026-06-06)

| ID | Status | Closure evidence |
|---|---|---|
| RFL-017 | CLOSED | `asb_topic_registry` — 12 canonical Hammer topics registered (`intelligence.next_step.resolved`, `onboarding.knowledge_gap_resolved`, `hammer.chat.message`, `prescription.daily.modality.{warmup|speed|strength|hitting|throwing|defense|baserunning|fueling|recovery}`); prior enum mismatch resolved by mapping onto canonical `ai_proposal` / `athlete_intent` / `observability` / `training_prescription` classes. |
| RFL-018 | CLOSED | `src/pages/AthleteCommand.tsx` — `<HammerOnboardingChat/>` (L54), `<HammerDailyPlan/>` (L62), `<HammerChat/>` (L64) mounted into the canonical `/command` route. |
| RFL-019 | CLOSED | `src/lib/hammer/prescription/dailyPlan.ts` — daily-plan dead-end routes patched: `/speed` → `/speed-lab`, `/baserunning` → `/baserunning-iq`. |

See `docs/asb/coach-hammer-runtime-ratification.md` for the full runtime ratification.


## RFL openings — Coach Hammer Production Reality Validation Sprint (2026-06-06)

| ID | Finding | Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| RFL-020 | Prior sprint never added the 9 coaching columns to `profiles`; onboarding answers have nowhere to persist. | H | Open |
| RFL-021 | Mounted Hammer surfaces emit zero events against the 16 registered Hammer topics — 0 hammer/onboarding/next_step/prescription events ever recorded. | H | Open |
| RFL-022 | Hammer surfaces emit no route-transition events; Section G confusion detection is structurally unmeasurable. | M | Open |

**Production reality scorecard:** Adoption 0% · Utilization 0% · Completion 0% · Guidance 0% · Conversation 0% → Overall **0/100**.

**Verdict:** Coach Hammer architectural GO is unchanged; production-reality **NO-GO**. Workstream **OPEN**. See `docs/asb/coach-hammer-production-reality-validation.md`.


## RFL openings — Athlete Development Intelligence Architecture Audit (2026-06-06)

| ID | Finding | Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| RFL-023 | Athlete-context persistence spine missing — `athleteContext.ts:96` and `knowledgeGaps.ts` reference 9 `profiles` columns that do not exist (`goal_summary`, `equipment_access`, `weekly_availability`, `lifting_age_years`, `training_focus`, `development_priorities`, `school_grade`, `weight_lbs`, `sport`). Hammer asks but cannot remember; every downstream intelligence layer is starved. | P0 | Open |
| RFL-024 | Athlete-development intelligence overall completeness = **20%** (Context 28% · Lifecycle 20% · Training-age 20% · Equipment 0% · Speed 0% wired · Fascial 13% · Sport-specialization 35% · Six-week 50% · Longitudinal 17%). Elite individualization structurally impossible until P0 closed. | P0 | Open |
| RFL-025 | Rich athlete-context tables (`sprint_analyses`, `athlete_load_tracking`, `physio_health_profiles`, `user_injury_progress`, `hammer_state_snapshots`) populated by capture pipelines but **completely unread** by any prescription / Hammer / roadmap surface — capture / projection gap is the second-largest blocker after RFL-023. | P0 | Open |

See `docs/asb/athlete-development-intelligence-audit.md` and `docs/asb/athlete-development-intelligence-roadmap.md`.


## RFL openings — Athlete Context Spine Constitution Sprint (2026-06-06)

| ID | Finding | Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| RFL-026 | Canonical athlete-context spine was constitutionally undefined prior to this sprint. No single document declared which variables, owners, propagation rules, lifecycle bands, and longitudinal semantics govern all developmental intelligence. Now ratified in `docs/asb/athlete-context-spine-constitution.md` (17 profile groups, six lifecycle bands, four equipment scopes, eight speed variables, five longitudinal classes). | P0 | Open (implementation pending) |
| RFL-027 | Equipment & environment model has no canonical enum, no scope precedence (persistent / session / temporary / inferred), no TTL semantics, and no resolver. Workout generators today cannot constitutionally honor an athlete's actual training environment. | P0 | Open |
| RFL-028 | Longitudinal adaptation rules (remember / forget / decay / accumulate / re-evaluate) constitutionally undefined. No decay engine, no re-evaluation triggers, no event-sourced training-age / lifting-age lineage. Consumers today read raw values without confidence, missingness, or decay envelopes — violating FC global continuity. | P0 | Open |

**Intelligence ceiling map (Section H):** Today ~20% · Minimum spine 35% · Recommended spine 70% · Elite spine 95%.

See `docs/asb/athlete-context-spine-constitution.md` and `docs/asb/athlete-context-spine-gap-analysis.md`.


## RFL closures & openings — Athlete Context Spine Implementation (P0-1) & Consumer Activation (P0-2) (2026-06-06)

| ID | Status | Closure / observation evidence |
|---|---|---|
| RFL-023 | CLOSED | `athlete_context` + `athlete_equipment_context` + `athlete_development_history_events` + `get_athlete_context_envelope()` RPC live; `athleteContext.ts` projects 16 spine vars with lineage. |
| RFL-025 | PARTIAL CLOSE | Spine envelope wired through `useHammerAthleteContext`; daily-plan + chat + onboarding consume 9–14 spine vars; deep biomechanical/load fields still unread — tracked under RFL-029…031. |
| RFL-026 | IMPLEMENTED | Constitution ratified + persistence layer live + projection envelope active. |
| RFL-027 | IMPLEMENTED | `athlete_equipment_context.scope` precedence (session > temporary > persistent > inferred) with TTL; resolver in `src/lib/hammer/context/equipment.ts`. |
| RFL-028 | IMPLEMENTED | `athlete_development_history_events` append-only event store live; 30-day form half-life in projection views; re-evaluation triggers wired. |

### P0-2 openings

| ID | Finding | Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| RFL-029 | `useWorkoutRecommendations`, `useDrillRecommendations`, `pieV2/recommendDrills` do not import the athlete-context envelope. Recommendation outputs do not vary on lifting age, lifecycle band, equipment, season phase, or development priorities. Spine exists; recommendation consumers ignore it. | P0 | Open |
| RFL-030 | Speed surfaces (`useSpeedSession*`, `runningAggregator.ts`, `sprint_analyses` readers, `softballStealAnalytics.ts`) consume zero spine variables. Acceleration / top-speed / stride / asymmetry / workload / freshness projections exist but no prescriptive consumer reads them. | P0 | Open |
| RFL-031 | Roadmap surfaces do not consume `goal_summary`, `goal_horizon`, `lifecycle_band`, `season_phase`, or `development_priorities`. `athlete_roadmap_progress` is written but no generator reads spine to produce per-athlete milestones. | P0 | Open |

**Intelligence estimate:** 35% → **~42%** after P0-2 (daily-plan, chat, onboarding consume spine; ecosystem still inactive).

See `docs/asb/athlete-context-spine-consumer-activation-ratification.md`.


## RFL closures — P0-3 Decision Activation Completion & Context Workstream Closure (2026-06-06)

| ID | Status | Closure evidence |
|---|---|---|
| RFL-029 | CLOSED | `src/hooks/useDrillRecommendations.ts`, `src/hooks/useWorkoutRecommendations.ts`, `src/lib/pieV2/recommendDrills.ts`, `src/lib/pieV2/recommendVideos.ts`, `src/utils/drillRecommendationEngine.ts` all consume the spine envelope via `projectEnvelope` + `applyContextFilter`. Differentiation: `uniqueDrillLegalSets: 4` across 9 personas (`scripts/audits/evidence/p0-3-differentiation.json`). |
| RFL-030 | CLOSED | `src/hooks/useSpeedProgress.ts` consumes the spine via `selectSpeedFocus`; exposes `speedFocus`, `contextSessionFocus`, `maxEffortAllowed`, `recommendedReps`, `contextSuppressions`, `speedProjection`. Acceleration / top speed / asymmetry / workload / freshness / season phase all influence outputs. Differentiation: `uniqueSpeedFoci: 5`. |
| RFL-031 | CLOSED | `src/hooks/useRoadmapProgress.ts::orderedMilestones` + `src/lib/pieV2/recommendDrills.ts` + `src/lib/pieV2/recommendVideos.ts` consume `orderRoadmapMilestones` / `applyContextFilter`. Differentiation: `uniqueRoadmapTops: 8/9`. |

**Daily-plan differentiation:** 9/9 unique fingerprints (`src/lib/hammer/prescription/dailyPlan.ts` now passes `projectEnvelope` + `selectSpeedFocus` into every modality builder).

**Utilization score:** ~92% overall (availability 100% · consumption 100% · differentiation 87%).

**Intelligence estimate:** 42% → **~65%**.

**P0 athlete-context workstream:** **CLOSED**.

**Public release verdict:** **GO WITH KNOWN LIMITATIONS** (non-blocking: Elite-tier consumers `P`, biomechanical fusion, multi-week periodization).

See `docs/asb/p0-3-decision-activation-ratification.md`.


## RFL openings — Launch Readiness Hostile Audit (2026-06-06)

Hostile audit withdrew the P0-3 "GO WITH KNOWN LIMITATIONS" verdict. New launch blockers identified.

| ID | Finding | Severity | Status | Surface | Harm |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RFL-032 | Brand-new athlete onboarding is bypassed at `src/pages/Auth.tsx:128-167` whenever the profile has any non-null name/role/subscription. `/onboarding/athlete` and therefore `HammerOnboardingChat` are unreachable for the majority of post-signup logins. First canonical event is never emitted; downstream spine consumers degrade to defaults. | P0 | Open | Auth → Dashboard | onboarding completion, trust, recommendation quality |
| RFL-033 | `compute-hammer-state` edge function has never booted in production — `BootFailure: Identifier 'getSeasonProfile' has already been declared at _shared/seasonPhase.ts:161`. Any server-derived Hammer state is silently absent. | P0 | Open | edge function `compute-hammer-state`; `_shared/seasonPhase.ts:161` | recommendation quality, observability, trust |
| RFL-034 | Minor-athlete supremacy (per Megaphase 151–160 cross-primitive doctrine + RR-doctrine) not enforced at the prescription layer. `src/lib/hammer/context/decisionFilters.ts` has zero `parent | minor | guardian | age` branches. Parent-flagged load concerns do not influence the daily plan. | P0 | Open | `decisionFilters.ts`; `dailyPlan.ts` | parent trust, safeguarding |
| RFL-035 | HammerChat is not grounded by the spine envelope (`projectEnvelope`); architecturally can contradict HammerDailyPlan. Same-session authority divergence risk. | P1 | Open | `useHammerChat` vs `buildHammerDailyPlan` | trust, authority coherence |
| RFL-036 | Drill recommendations collapse into 4 legality sets across 9 personas (5 personas share a bucket). Repetition risk. | P1 | Open | `useDrillRecommendations`, `recommendDrills.ts` | recommendation quality, retention |
| RFL-037 | Empty / partial / stale states across Dashboard, Workout/Drill recommendation surfaces, and Roadmap lack the canonical (explanation + next action + recovery) triplet. Only `HammerDailyPlan` blocks reliably exhibit it. | P1 | Open | Dashboard, rec hooks, roadmap | trust, retention |
| RFL-038 | Returning-athlete staleness is invisible. Spine confidence/missingness degrades behind the scenes per FC global continuity, but no UI surface signals degraded confidence. | P1 | Open | All athlete surfaces | trust |
| RFL-039 | Injured-athlete pain-self-report → next-plan suppression latency is unbounded. No real-time hand-off between pain capture and prescription gating. | P1 | Open | injury capture → `decisionFilters.ts` | safeguarding (RR-6 spirit) |
| RFL-040 | No RTP-authorization surface. RR-6 requires explicit human authorization for return-to-play; current UI does not surface or block on it. | P1 | Open | (absence) | safeguarding |
| RFL-041 | Athlete navigation is polluted by 100+ routes including `/admin`, `/owner/*`, `/ops/*`, `/runtime/*`. Cognitive overload + accidental engineering-surface navigation. | P1 | Open | `src/App.tsx:207-330` | usability, trust |
| RFL-042 | `src/pages/Auth.tsx:90-167` post-login routing decided by a 4-table parallel query with no abort logic. Race-prone on slow networks. | P1 | Open | `Auth.tsx` | reliability |
| RFL-043 | Parent-invite resolution at `src/pages/AcceptParentInvite.tsx:46-55` caps athlete-timeline lookup at 200 events. Silent failure for deep timelines. | P1 | Open | `AcceptParentInvite.tsx` | parent activation |

**Launch verdict:** **NO-GO** until RFL-032 / RFL-033 / RFL-034 closed. After P0 remediation, expected to revert to **GO WITH KNOWN LIMITATIONS** (P1s as disclosed launch debt).

See `docs/asb/launch-readiness-hostile-audit.md` for full evidence and rebuttals.


## RFL closures — P0 Launch Blocker Remediation Sprint (2026-06-06)

| ID | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| RFL-032 | **CLOSED** | `src/pages/Auth.tsx` sign-in adds `asb_events`-count query; new athlete-cohort branch routes profile-only-no-event users to `/onboarding/athlete`. Ledger truth (`hasFirstEvent`) is now the canonical onboarding authority. See `docs/asb/p0-launch-blocker-remediation-ratification.md` §RFL-032. |
| RFL-033 | **CLOSED** | Removed duplicate `getSeasonProfile` from `supabase/functions/_shared/seasonPhase.ts`. `compute-hammer-state` deploys and returns `200 { status: "ok", … }`. See ratification doc §RFL-033. |
| RFL-034 | **CLOSED** | `decisionFilters.ts` + `dailyPlan.ts` now consume `isMinor` / `parentSupremacyActive` / `parentConcerns` from the spine. Minor + parent-concern personas verified: speed→`tempo_recovery`, daily speed block `awaiting-input`, roadmap high-risk milestones suppressed. Evidence: `scripts/audits/evidence/p0-3-differentiation.json` (11/11 unique daily plans). See ratification doc §RFL-034. |

**Launch verdict (post-remediation):** **GO WITH LIMITATIONS.** P1s (RFL-035…RFL-043) carried forward as disclosed launch debt.


## RFL openings — Athlete Experience & Retention Audit (2026-06-07)

Audit-only sweep of onboarding, daily use, progression, retention, navigation, trust, and delight. See `docs/asb/athlete-experience-retention-audit.md`. No code changed.

| ID | Finding | Severity | Status | Surface | Harm |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RFL-044 | `HammerDailyPlan` renders 9 modality blocks simultaneously on first visit with no "do these first" hierarchy → overwhelm for cold-start athletes. | P1 | Open | `src/components/hammer/HammerDailyPlan.tsx` | onboarding completion, engagement |
| RFL-045 | `ProgressDashboard` mounts 15+ HIE cards in a single scroll → cognitive overload; athlete cannot identify the headline signal. | P1 | Open | `src/pages/ProgressDashboard.tsx` | engagement, perceived value |
| RFL-046 | `Dashboard.tsx:262-287` interleaves module-purchase paywall CTAs with performance surfaces; new athletes see commercial CTAs adjacent to daily intelligence. | P1 | Open | `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` | trust, commercial-survivability boundary |
| RFL-047 | Daily plan has no explicit "tomorrow promise" / return hook beyond the implicit "plan exists." | P2 | Open | `HammerDailyPlan.tsx` | retention (D1→D2) |
| RFL-048 | `/today` and `/command` both surface "do this now" — ambiguous primary daily destination. | P1 | Open | `src/pages/Today.tsx`, `AthleteCommand.tsx` | engagement, clarity |
| RFL-049 | Roadmap progress surfaces "what's next" but does not headline trajectory delta ("how fast am I moving"). | P1 | Open | `useRoadmapProgress`, roadmap surfaces | perceived value, retention |
| RFL-050 | `DualStreakDisplay` mounted only on `/progress`; not on `/command` or `/today` where daily decision happens. | P2 | Open | `src/components/dashboard/DualStreakDisplay.tsx` | engagement, delight |
| RFL-051 | `RecentEventsPreview` lists events without weekly/period summarization ("you completed X this week"). | P2 | Open | `RecentEventsPreview` | progression visibility |
| RFL-052 | D7/D30 retention hooks absent on athlete home: no weekly digest preview, no monthly milestone callout. Hammer never says "here's what you did this week." | P1 | Open | `/command`, `/dashboard` | D7+ retention |
| RFL-053 | **`/dashboard` and `/command` both function as athlete-home.** Post-login default lands on `/dashboard`, where `HammerOnboardingChat` / `HammerDailyPlan` / `HammerChat` are not mounted. The entire P0-3 differentiation, spine activation, and minor-supremacy work is invisible to athletes who do not deep-link to `/command`. Disproof attempted: Auth.tsx new-athlete branch only covers the first event; subsequent logins land on `/dashboard`. Disproof fails. | **P0** | Open | `src/pages/Auth.tsx`, `Dashboard.tsx`, `AthleteCommand.tsx` | **launch-blocking experience risk** — nullifies P0-3 investment for returning athletes |
| RFL-054 | `/digest`, `/forecast`, `/calendar`, `/cycle`, `/safety-center` exist as routes but are not surfaced from athlete home navigation → hidden functionality. | P2 | Open | nav | usability |
| RFL-055 | Drill / workout / video recommendation cards do not consistently expose inline `why` lineage. Violates EI-1…EI-10 athlete-intelligence-delivery "lineage one interaction away" expectation outside of `HammerDailyPlan`. | P1 | Open | `useDrillRecommendations`, `useWorkoutRecommendations`, video shelves | trust, intelligence-delivery doctrine |
| RFL-056 | MPI score rendered on `ProgressDashboard` (and elsewhere) as `N • grade` with no inline lineage path to "how was this computed?" | P1 | Open | `ProgressDashboard.tsx:39`, MPI surfaces | trust |
| RFL-057 | Onboarding completes silently into the 9-modality plan — no "first plan generated" celebration / acknowledgement moment. | P2 | Open | onboarding → command handoff | delight, activation |
| RFL-058 | No before/after surface after drill completion — athlete completes a drill and sees no "this changed your projection by X." | P2 | Open | post-drill surfaces | delight, perceived value |

**Athlete-experience launch verdict:** **NO-GO** on a single P0 (RFL-053). After resolution, expected **GO WITH LIMITATIONS** with P1s (RFL-035…RFL-058) as disclosed launch debt.



## RFL closures — RFL-053 Athlete Home Authority Remediation Sprint (2026-06-07)

| ID | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| RFL-053 | **CLOSED** | Canonical athlete home set to `/command`. Three edits: `src/pages/Auth.tsx:182-188` (post-login), `src/pages/ProfileSetup.tsx:295` (post-onboarding), `src/pages/ResetPassword.tsx:47-48` (post-reset) all now `navigate("/command", { replace: true })`. `/dashboard` retained as module-discovery catalog (still mounted at `App.tsx:220`, still target of per-module back-buttons). Onboarding gate (RFL-032), edge-function fix (RFL-033), minor-supremacy (RFL-034), and P0-3 differentiation all verified intact. See `docs/asb/rfl-053-athlete-home-remediation-ratification.md`. |

**Launch verdict (post-RFL-053):** **GO WITH LIMITATIONS.** P1/P2s (RFL-035…RFL-052, RFL-054…RFL-058) carried forward as disclosed launch debt.


## Final Production Release Verification (2026-06-07)

All OPEN RFLs re-classified with no severity inflation in `docs/asb/final-production-release-verification.md` §F. No release blockers found. No new RFLs opened by verification.

**Final launch verdict:** **RELEASE AUTHORIZED.** See `docs/asb/hammers-modality-v1-ratification.md`.


## Launch Operations Layer (2026-06-07)

Post-ratification operations doctrine established. Reality remains the organism's governing authority; the RFL is the single intake path for athlete / coach / parent / recruiter / support / operational signals. See `docs/asb/v1-launch-operations-plan.md` for the full runbook.

### Intake pipeline

```text
capture channel → triage owner → 3-axis severity rubric → RFL entry → Section F board → V1.x or V2
```

Severity axes (NOT effort): athlete impact, retention impact, trust impact.

### V1.x prioritization snapshot

Re-ranked OPEN RFLs (full rubric in `v1-launch-operations-plan.md` §F).

- **Immediate V1.x** (score ≥7): RFL-055, RFL-056, RFL-052, RFL-044
- **Near-term V1.x** (score 5–6): RFL-048, RFL-049, RFL-045, RFL-037, RFL-041, RFL-038, RFL-036, RFL-042, RFL-046
- **V2** (score ≤4): RFL-035, RFL-039, RFL-040, RFL-043, RFL-047, RFL-050, RFL-051, RFL-054, RFL-057, RFL-058

### Daily ritual

Leadership checks (in order): activation rate (prior 24h cohort), D1 retention (24–48h cohort), failure-event count at Section C Top-5 stages, RFL inbox.

### Re-evaluation triggers

Any RFL is re-ranked when (a) a capture-channel signal shows broader harm, (b) a Section D scoreboard breach is causally linked, or (c) a new RFL compounds an existing one.

## Reality Validation Protocol — active

`docs/asb/v1-reality-validation-protocol.md` is now active. Cohorts C1 (10),
C2 (25), C3 (50) will produce Reality Validation Reports using
`docs/asb/reality-validation-cohort-template.md`. RFL intake continues to
use the pipeline defined in `v1-launch-operations-plan.md` §E with no
severity inflation. The V1.x prioritization board in §F is re-ranked from
cohort reality evidence, never invented inside a cohort report.

## Positive Reality Evidence

Repeated successes (≥2 athletes on the same surface) are appended here as
confirmation of constitutional expectations. Not RFLs. Each entry cites the
cohort report that promoted it.

| Date | Surface | Pattern | Athletes | Expectation confirmed | Source report |
|------|---------|---------|----------|-----------------------|---------------|
